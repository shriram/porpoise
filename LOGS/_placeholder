This file only exists because

- you can't check an empty folder into a git repoistory
- you need this folder to store the logs
- not having it in the repository would have meant one more configuration step

Obviously, this file will be overridden if you ever have a user named `_placeholder`. But that's fine, you don't need to be reading this.

Why are you reading this?

Why are you *still* reading this?
